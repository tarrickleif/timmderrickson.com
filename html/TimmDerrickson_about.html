        <p> I am a full time learner, I spend my time trying to gain any knowledge available to pass it forward to the customers. Both internal and external. I am currently an analyst at a mid-sized jewelry company and I spend my time there trying to understand customer behavior, sales, and our supply chain. I have recently become very interested in, almost obsessed with, learning how to write code. If I am writing VBA to automate processes with the jewelry company, HMTL CSS and JavaScript to create a website, or Java to model real world objects. It is now the one thing I do everyday. In the future I see myself using this new skill and passion to create, and to make people's lives easier. I have had the idea of improving people's lives for as long as I can remember, but learning to code has given me a new direction to use that idea.</p>
